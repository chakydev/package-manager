# Next.js Template

Hey, Tailwind V4 sucks. Everything that happened in web dev since like, January 2025 is a complete disaster.

So I made this template which uses the good old Tailwind V3, all that good stuff.

It doesn't include any BS. Just exactly what you need.

By the way, this was cloned from [Mazeway](https://github.com/mazeway-dev/mazeway)

Because that project actually uses cool tech.
