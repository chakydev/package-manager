# Chaky

## Introduction

Ever wanted to have full control over your dependencies? That's what Chaky is - a package manager where you truly own your code.

Want to modify a package? No problem. Need to fix a bug without waiting for upstream? Go for it.

### The Problem

The traditional node_modules approach has some fundamental issues:
- Limited control over your dependencies
- Difficult to modify packages when needed
- Vendor lock-in that restricts code ownership
- Dependency hell when things go wrong

### The Solution

Chaky gives you complete ownership of your dependencies by bringing them directly into your codebase. This means:
- Full visibility into your dependencies
- Freedom to modify packages as needed
- No more waiting for upstream fixes
- True code ownership

### Status

This project is currently in early development. Want to help shape the future of package management? Jump in and contribute!
